'''
1. This program is written for a scenario of performing network CIDR IP subnetting technic that is used to create number of subnets 
   from a given base network address.
2. User will be given an IPv4 network address, the program will then prompt the user to enter the 32 bits IPv4 address from the first 
   octet to the fourth octet one by one (e.g., 192.168.10.0/24).
3. Based on the user input, the base IP address (before subnetting) will be displayed to the console.
4. Then the program will again prompt the user to input the network bits, host bits, number of subnets that are required to be created, 
   and number of host bits to borrow from the host bits for calculating the block size and each new subnets.
